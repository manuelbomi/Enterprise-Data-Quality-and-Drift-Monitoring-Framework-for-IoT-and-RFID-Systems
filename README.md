# Enterprise Data Quality and Drift Monitoring Framework for IoT and RFID Systems

#### Ensuring data quality in IoT and RFID systems is essential for maintaining reliable, automated, and data-driven decision-making. Poor-quality sensor data leads to flawed analytics, inaccurate predictions, and operational inefficiencies. A layered data quality and drift monitoring strategy ensures data remains accurate, complete, consistent, valid, and trustworthy as environments and hardware evolve.


## 1. The Case for Data Quality in IoT/RFID Systems

#### IoT and RFID infrastructures continuously generate large volumes of time-sensitive data from distributed sensors and readers. Because these data streams power automation, analytics, and AI models, maintaining quality across their lifecycle is critical. In these systems:

#### Garbage in â†’ garbage out directly translates to expensive operational errors.

#### Hardware degradation, environmental shifts, or firmware updates can silently corrupt data.

#### Early detection of drift and quality degradation prevents cascading business impact.


## 2. A Layered Approach to Data Quality

#### A robust data quality architecture for IoT and RFID systems follows a multi-layered approach, covering every stage from data generation to governance.
